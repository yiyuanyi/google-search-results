# google-search-results
remake of google search results page

haven't coded for a while so hoping to refresh previous knowledge before moving on to javascript

I should be able to display writing HTML with ease, and using my current knowledge as well as google searching to write CSS and recreate a close representation of the google search results page.
REMEMBER: It doesn't have to be perfect !!!
